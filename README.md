# What is neural network
A neural network is an abstract concept which is derived from the neurons from our brain. So, before diving further into details let’s step back and take a look at what the neurons in our brain do and how do the artificial neural network resemble the at natural neurons in our brain.
But wait a second, why are we even doing this? Why do we need a neural network?
We have come far as a species but we still face a lot of issues which are yet to be solved. There’s the impending threat of climate change, the possibility of biochemical warfare and the possibility of an asteroid impact. These are non-trivial problems that could take our biological neural networks many generations to solve. But what if we could harness this power? What if we could have a artificial neural network that could work just like our brain but would be more powerful and faster than our brain. Basically, what if we could have an artificial brain that is a million times faster than our natural brain? 


We will build a simple single layer feed forward neural network(also called a perceptron). There are three steps involved:

* Build
* Train
* Test
